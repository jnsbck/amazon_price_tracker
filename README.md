### A simple tool, to keep track of prices on amazon.de/amazon.com.

##### This Tool is far from finished and still lacks a lot of basic functionalities (e.g. specifying currency).

##### Functionanlities still to be added:
- send email if price drops below threshhold or by a margin,
- send email at request of daily/weekly etc. with current prices and plot of price history attached
- display number of items left in stock if low and if available
- check for internet connection before executing price fetch. In case of no connection postpone fetching by time delta
- comparing amazons prices to other vendors
