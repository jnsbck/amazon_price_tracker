### A simple tool, to keep track of prices on amazon.de/amazon.com.
This tool grew out of my need to be able to keep an eye on the price of different copmuter parts for my workstation build. 
It basically does what is stated, however I would still like to add further functionality in later releases.
I have only tested it on amazon.de, but I think it should work on other domains extensions.

##### This Tool is far from finished and still lacks a lot of basic functionalities (e.g. specifying currency).

##### Functionanlities still to be added:
- no item on this page ERROR
- output status to a logfile while its running
- send email if price drops below threshhold or by a margin,
- send email at request of daily/weekly etc. with current prices and plot of price history attached
- display number of items left in stock if low and if available
- check for internet connection before executing price fetch. In case of no connection postpone fetching by time delta
- comparing amazons prices to other vendors
